# Genetic Algorithm
Evolutionary Algorithms course at Leiden University

In matlab implment the following:

- Search for a bit-string of length n, which yield as small autocorrelation as possible
- Test the performance on the 6 dimensions
- Compare the performance of your GA implementation to Monte Carlo (MC) search. 
- Use a maximum of 5,000 * dimension function evaluations for each run, and report on your results averaged over 20 runs per approach.
